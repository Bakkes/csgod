csgod
=====


csgod is a daemon for monitoring an instance of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and hooking onto in-game events. At the moment, hooks are by pairing a regex with a function. When the regex matches a line of console output, the function is called.

Additional hooks can be easily written.
